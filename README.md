<h2>UUV Navigation using CVM</h2>

This is a ROS1-noetic workspace which contains the code for implementation of the Curvature velocity method to locally avoid obstacles underwater using the RexROV2 vehicle.
This uses the <b> uuv_simulator </b> developed here: [https://github.com/uuvsimulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator)
