<h2>UUV Navigation using CVM</h2>
 
 This is a ROS1-noetic workspace which contains the code for implementation of the Curvature velocity method to locally avoid obstacles underwater using the RexROV2 vehicle.
 This uses the <b> uuv_simulator </b> developed here: [https://github.com/uuvsimulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator)

The [Launch File](https://github.com/uuvsimulator) can be used to launch the world. The [script file](https://github.com/Pranav-Malpure/uuv_navigation/blob/master/uuv_simulator_orig/src/rexrov2/rexrov2_gazebo/scripts/isurp.py) can be used to run the simulation.
